## Notes of things to change in future years ##

- The second timer in the presentation did not work
- Make sure people test the installation of git first,
  macs can have issues finding the exec, it appeared in 
  usr/local/bin/git I think, you have to change this
  manually. Also go to tools>version control also helps
- Some beginniers need an introduction to Rstudio projects
- Make sure people dont mess around with working directories
- Shiny practical may be too hard for beginners. Make a couple
  of easier ones, or walk through them with the class
